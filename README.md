# Hello-World
making my way back to Git

adding edits to this file so I can commit the changes?

# This is another section
## some stuff goes here
it might look like **this**
## some stuff might also go down here
it could also look like *this*


`var helloWorld = "yep";`

### One time for a restaurant I used the [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/)[API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search)
it was pretty cool
